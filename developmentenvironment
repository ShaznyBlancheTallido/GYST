Currently using atom as my text editor, it also allows plug ins to help with development.
For example I can see a live reload of my html files (with command: Command Shift P, then select sever to fun from)
This also allows allows all of my html files to be in one place, hence allowing for easier development.
Therefore also allowing it to be easier to push this folder into my GYST development repository on GitHub which can act as my development portfolio.

In Chrome you can use the Developer Tools (i.e. show which page is loading within a folder etc.)
It can also show the elements and its relation to its CSS Style Sheet
Or with the command: control U :to see the actual source code in another tab
